<p>The semantic tags help to break up the document, and make the html code more readable for other coders.</p>
<p>The html is what loads first because that is what the browser needs to know what to do. Everything after that is pretty random</p>
<p>I learned that I can create snippets in sublime. I probably won't be creating any at this point, but maybe further down the line I will.</p>

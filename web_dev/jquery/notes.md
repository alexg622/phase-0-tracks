I'll first spend 30-1 hour researching jquery on youtube to get a broad idea of it and then spend the rest of the time googling more specific things about jquery. I'll take a 5 min break every 30 mins or whenever I start to feel a little brain fried. 

The best way I found to learn jquery was to learn a little, and then test out what I learned and then take a break. Then learn a little more, test it out and then take a break. I feel like putting to practice what you learn is what really helps the most. The most difficult thing was learning how to link the jquery to the html and downloading the proper jquery files and linking them, but after I got that good to go its just research and practice I feel like. Trial and error to learn it.

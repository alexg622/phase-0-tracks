linux is a free operating system that is a great platform and cross-platfrom that can be used with phones, computers, and used for video games and peices of technology like that. 

A VPS basically allows the creator to a level of access to the operating system to the point where they can pretty much install whatever they want. 

You wouldn't want to run programs as root because it makes you vulnerable to bugs and things like that since the root user has access to do whatever they want pretty much so if the program had a bug that wouldn't be good.

# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

Version control allows multiple people at once to work on a version of a project without altering the master version

A branch is a copy of the master branch that can be altered and then later merged into the master branch. 

A commit is a way to save your work and make a note of how you altered your work. A good commit message is one that lets you know what changes you made to your work. 

A merge confilct is when Git is not able to merge files. This usually occurs when two people are working on the same file and change the same line. Or when one person deletes the file and the other does not.
